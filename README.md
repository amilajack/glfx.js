# glfx.js

## What is glfx.js?
glfx.js, an image effects library powered by WebGL

Adjust photos in your browser efficiently in realtime. It uses your graphics card for image effects that would be impossible to apply in real-time with JavaScript alone.

There is a caveat to glfx.js. Due to the same origin policy, JavaScript is only allowed to read images that originate from the same domain as the script reading them, so you may have to host the images you modify.
